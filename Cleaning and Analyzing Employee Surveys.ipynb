    "This project extensively cleaned responses from two Australian employee surveys, then combined in order to assess whether resignations are typically motivated by job dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the initial analysis above, we can tentatively conclude that employees with 7 or more years of service are more likely to resign due to some kind of dissatisfaction with the job than employees with less than 7 years of service. However, we need to handle the rest of the missing data to finalize our analysis."
