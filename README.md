# Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys
by Nicholas Archambault

This project examines the results of two Australian employee exit surveys administered by the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute of Queensland.

## Goals
1. Perform extensive cleaning and reorganization of the data to allow for the merging of each independent and unaffiliated dataset into a combined dataframe.
2. Handle missing values and errors in data.
3. Understand whether employee resignations are typically motivated by job or workplace dissatisfaction.

## Output
Plots and analysis concluding which experience brackets of workers are the most likely to resign over job dissatisfaction.
